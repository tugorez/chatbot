# Yet Another Chatbot App 🤖

> Because what better way to dust off your React skills than building chatbot #9,472,816?

## What's This?

Just me, getting my hands dirty with React again. It's been a minute. Instead of another todo app (we have enough of those), I figured I'd build a chatbot—because talking to machines is apparently the future, and I should probably remember how to make them talk back.

## Why Though?

- 🧠 **Muscle memory is real** — and mine forgot what `useState` does
- ⚛️ **React moves fast** — blink and there's a new hook
- 💬 **Chatbots are fun** — instant feedback, endless possibilities
- 🚀 **Next.js is slick** — might as well learn the cool kids' framework

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and watch me figure this out in real-time.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** — because plain React is so 2019
- **React** — the whole point of this exercise
- **Vibes** — abundant
